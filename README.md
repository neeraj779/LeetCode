# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform for coding interviews and coding contests, with a large collection of coding problems in different categories and difficulty levels. I use this repository to keep track of my solutions, as well as to practice and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem number, with each problem in its own folder. Within each folder, there is a README file with the problem description and any additional notes or insights I have about the problem. There is also a solution file, which contains my code for solving the problem. The solution is typically written in C++.

## Usage

Feel free to use my solutions as a reference or for inspiration, but please do not copy them directly for your own submissions. LeetCode is a platform for practicing and improving your skills, and copying solutions defeats the purpose. That being said, I hope my solutions can be helpful to others in understanding the problem or finding alternative approaches.

## Contributions

If you find an error in one of my solutions, or if you have a better or more efficient solution, please feel free to submit a pull request. I welcome contributions and feedback.


Happy coding!
